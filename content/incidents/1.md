**Example**

We are unable to allocate VMs to run Databricks jobs. This will cause all analytics to be delayed. We have identified the root-cause to be a bug on Azure Billing side and have engaged with the Azure support team to resolve this as soon as possible.

4/13/2022 15:30hrs PT Still working with Azure on resolution. We are running a pared down data pipeline to unblock everyone, while in parallel we figure out a full solution.

20:00hrs PT The Azure issues have been resolved. Analytics are being processed and are catching back up. Incident impact was limited to processing delays; no data was lost.

4/14/2022 15:00hrs All services back to normal.
